What's in here?
```
main1.py           Send stream from N cameras to a single multiprocess
main2.py           Send stream from N cameras to N multiprocesses
                   (each camera has it's own multiprocess)
main3.py           TODO: like main2.py, but each multiprocess also communicates
                   with a common "master" process
```
